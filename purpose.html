        <section>
            <p> <br> This project was created to demonstrate how Black people are disproportionately killed by
                the police in the United States of America.<br><br></p>
        </section>
        <h3><b>Introduction:</b></h3>
        <section>
            <p> When it comes to interpreting data in the realm of racial justice, it’s important that
                we be responsible in the way data is used. Too often is data used to perpetuate racist
                ideas, which are then used to justify injustices against people of color. <br><br>

                So instead of using this data to perpetuate racist ideas, we are going to try to
                perpetuate an antiracist idea. In the case of this project, that means using this
                data to show that the disparities in police killings are the result of a long legacy
                of institutional and systemic racism. We hope that this project can be a valued resource
                for those seeking justice for Black lives.<br><br>
            </p>
        </section>
        <h3><b>Datasets Used: </b></h3>
        <section>
            <p> We make use of two databases: the Fatal Encounters Police Killings database, which
                contains data on police killings dating from 2000 to 2020, and KFF’s Population Distribution
                by Race/Ethnicity database, which contains data on each state’s demographics by race.<br><br>

                It’s important to note that the police killings data may not be completely accurate, as it’s
                possible that some police departments either did not report or purged their data. It’s also
                important to note that this is only the data on police killings. There are even more, and
                possibly even wider disparities when it comes to vehicle stops, arrests, assaults, and more.
                <br><br></p>
        </section>
        <h3><b>Calculations: </b></h3>
        <section>
            <p> The police killings data is used to measure the proportion of Black people killed by police,
                and the demographics data is used to measure the proportion of Black people in the state’s
                population. We then calculate the disparity between the killings and population proportions.<br>
<br>
                Similar calculations are done for those who are Non-Black (White, Asian, Hispanic, Native, etc).
                The two disparities for Black people and Non-Black people are then compared to generate a final
                statistic: a Disparity Factor, or how many times more likely a Black person is to be killed by
                police than a Non-Black person.
                <br><br></p>
        </section>
        <h3><b>Diagrams: </b></h3>
        <figure>
            <img class="center" alt="Graph1" src="images/Graph1.jpg">
        </figure>
        <section>
            <p> <br>In general, a higher Black population percentage tends to result in a
                large percent of Black Killings. Note that the vertical axis is compressed here,
                so this graph doesn’t visually demonstrate that the percent killings is usually
                double that of the percent population.<br></p>
        </section>
        <figure>
            <img class="center" alt="Graph2" src="images/Graph2.jpg">
        </figure>
        <section>
            <p> <br> Notice that the disparity factor is most often 1 or greater, despite what the
                percent population is. The states with the lowest population percentage have the greatest
                variance. A majority of the data seems to lie in the 2 to 4 range.<br><br></p>
        </section>


        <h3><b>Results & Analysis: </b></h3>
        <section>
            <p> In 38 states, a Black person is at least 2 times more likely to be killed by police than
                a Non-Black person. In at least 12 states, a Black person is at least 4 times more likely
                to be killed by police than a Non-Black person. <br><br>

                One likely explanation for this high range of disparities is a large amount of racist bias
                against Black people. This has been demonstrated time and time again, whether it be through
                excessive use of force, unjust arrest, or harassment. <br><br>

                In at least 3 states, Illinois, Utah, and New Jersey, a Black person is at least 5 times more
                likely to be killed by police than a Non-Black person. Two of these states are home to large
                urban centers home to large Black populations, e.g. Chicago and Cook Country in Illinois,
                and Jersey City in New Jersey. This leaves out Utah, whose Black population percentage is
                only about 1%. It is possible that the only explanation here is that these states house
                police forces with a racist bias against Black people. <br><br>

                In 3 states, Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming, the population of Black people is either
                so close to or equal to zero that there is no disparity that can be calculated. It may also
                be that because there are so few Non-White people in this state that race isn’t even recorded
                with their police killings. One explanation for this may be the result of redlining and
                segregation, both of which were done to keep Black people out of White communities.
                <br><br></p>
        </section>
        <h3><b>Conclusion: </b></h3>
        <section>
            <p> Overall, it’s clear that there is a widespread racial disparity in police killings in the US.
                In states like Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and California, there are disparities that
                show that even though Black people may only make up anywhere from around 10-20% of the
                population, they make up around 40-50% of the police killings in those states. Even in states
                like Utah and Vermont, where the Black proportion of the population is only 1-2%, there are
                still disparities that show that a Black man is at least twice as likely to be killed by
                police in either of these states.<br><br>

                It seems that regardless of the state’s size, population, and proportion of the Black
                population, that there are disparities nationwide in police killings. This likely results
                from a centuries-long legacy of systemic racism, in the form of racist rhetorics that falsely
                frame Black people as dangerous or subhuman, to racist policies that create racial
                disparities, to racist politicians who seek to perpetuate both these rhetorics and these
                policies.
                <br><br></p>
        </section>
        <h3><b>Our Opinion: </b></h3>
        <section>
            <p> The police exist for a single primary purpose: to enforce the law and stop crime. And so
                one may assume higher rates of police killings of Black people to be correlated to high
                crime rates. This, however, is a racist rhetoric that has been disproven many times over
                the years. In reality, it is an unbiased association of Blackness with criminality. <br><br>

                Let’s say we did assume this correlation to be true. One may easily conclude that in order
                to quell higher rates of crime, one needs to increase the number of police. This, however,
                leads to a racist policy, wherein police are used to suppress Black people’s rights based
                on an unbiased assumption. And this is what has happened over the past 50 years
                (e.g. War on Drugs, Mass Incarceration, Police Killings, etc).<br><br>

                It is clear today that an increase of policing does not quell crime. This is likely
                because police do not prevent crime from happening in the first place. The police only
                treat the symptoms, and not the cause, of criminal activity, therefore we should seek to
                find the cause of crime and treat the problems there. <br><br>

                One way we can do this is to invest in greater socioeconomic opportunities for poor
                communities of color. We could improve availability of housing, education, healthcare,
                and jobs, the lack of which is known to lead to increased rates of crime. Another way
                is police reform, where police forces would be required to improve their training, wear
                body cameras, and take implicit bias tests. <br><br>

                However, even if this did all happen, this does not solve the true root cause of these
                police killings: a legacy of systemic racism that has infected our institutions. It is here
                that we cannot settle for any amount of economic stimulus or reform alone. We cannot trust
                an inherently racist law enforcement system to fix itself. Therefore, we must completely
                rethink how we do not just policing, but everything from law, justice, prisons, and all
                parts of the US justice system. It is by these means that we can reduce the disparities
                like the ones we have shown here today. <br>
